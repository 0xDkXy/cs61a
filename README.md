# CS61A Labs, Homeworks & Projects

It's a repository for the self-learning of the course CS61A

[CS61A 2022 spring](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/)

## Tips:
  - **The `gui_file` directory in the projects lost, I have no idea why git cannot trace the `gui_file`
    dir. So if you want to use final projects, please go to the [CS61A 2022
    spring](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/) website to download the origin ZIP file to
    get the `gui_file`.**
